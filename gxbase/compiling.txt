Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003
---------------------------------
  0. Check the doc\readme.txt for detailed
     information about the current version.
  1. Double-click on 'gxbase
.sln'
  2. From the menu select:
       Build, Batch Build...
  3. Make sure that there is a tick next to the
     following four configurations:
       Debug
       Debug Multithreaded DLL
       Release
       Release Multithreaded DLL
  4. Select 'Rebuild' to rebuild all four
     configurations. Note: it is important to
     select 'Rebuild' rather than 'Build', or
     the libraries may be broken.
  5. Wait until the build operation completes,
     and it should say:
       "Rebuild All: 4 succeeded, 0 failed.."
  6. Close Visual Studio .NET
  7. Double-click on 'dist.bat' which will
     copy the headers/libraries/docs into
     the distribution folder:
       dist
     The dist folder contains everything needed
     to use gxbase, so it isn't necessary to
     distribute the entire source.
  8. Note: the VS.NET libraries will not be
     compatible with VC++ 6.0 owing to changes to
     the standard template library support.
