This folder contains a number of sample gxbase projects.
They have associated Visual Studio project files. Note that
they include and link the gxbase library from:
  ..\..\inc
  ..\..\lib
Therefore they will likely use the version of gxbase
installed above this folder, even if you have a different
version in your system H/LIB paths.
