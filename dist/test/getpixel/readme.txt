This is a simple painting application with a 'clone' brush that copies
pixels from one part of an image to another. Right-Click with the mouse
to select the origin for the clone brush, then Left-Click and drag to paint.

This program was written to test the Image::GetPixel method. It also
partially tests the Image::glDrawPixels() and Image::glSetPixel methods.
