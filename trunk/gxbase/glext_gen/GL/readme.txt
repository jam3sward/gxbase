OpenGL Extension Header Files
-----------------------------

This folder contains OpenGL header files, specifying the OpenGL
extension function and function pointer names.

These can be downloaded from the OpenGL Extension Registry
at the following address:

  http://www.opengl.org/registry/

Other vendors such as nVidia, ATI and 3DLabs also distribute
OpenGL extension header files, which may also be compatible.
